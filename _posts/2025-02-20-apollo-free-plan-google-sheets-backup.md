## How to Shift from 1st to 2nd Gear for FREE

Sales is the land of words and metaphors.
Anything can be a sales metaphor.
But car jargon is some of the most used, and we don't have to be original yet. 
So let's imagine a car in park.
This is your Founder Led Sales mode - where the charisma of the founder is like a magnet. 

Not a sustainable magnet though.
The thing with charisma is, it's only seen when shown.
The founder has to do interviews, shake hands, kiss babies and party with questionable types.
So after the first 10, or 100 customers - if you like your founder, you have to protect them from being chewed up by the System.
Charisma fades the more people rub against it.

So you start calling and sending emails.
This is 1st gear.
You're not going fast but you're safe.

After a certain number of messages, rejections and broken dreams - you decide you're worth more than this.
For some, the click happens after 6 months.
For some, 6 years.
At the edge are types like the KFC grandpa and the McDonalds guy played by Michael Keaton - who go founder mode on the age you're supposed to retire.
And some take the pain in stride and get used to it.

Once you do decide to evolve - the next step is 2nd gear.
Where you increase the risk to gain more momentum.
