## How to Shift from 1st to 2nd Gear for FREE

This article is about how to send multiple sequences using the Apollo.io free plan.

Sales is the land of words and metaphors.
Anything can be a sales metaphor.
But car jargon is some of the most used, and we don't have to be original yet. 
So let's imagine a car in park.
This is your Founder Led Sales mode - where the charisma of the founder is like a magnet. 

Not a sustainable magnet though.
The thing with charisma is, it's only seen when shown.
The founder has to do interviews, shake hands, kiss babies and party with questionable types.
So after the first 10, or 100 customers - if you like your founder, you have to protect them from being chewed up by the System.
Charisma fades the more people rub against it.

So you start calling and sending emails.
This is 1st gear.
You're not going fast but you're safe.

After a certain number of messages, rejections and broken dreams - you decide you're worth more than this.
For some, the click happens after 6 months.
For some, 6 years.
At the edge are types like the KFC grandpa and the McDonalds guy played by Michael Keaton - who go founder mode on the age you're supposed to retire.
And some take the pain in stride and get used to it.

Once you do decide to evolve - the next step is 2nd gear.
Where you increase the risk to gain more momentum. 

This is where it's best to think of Jeff Bezos and Amazon's shitty desks. 
I know they were s**tyy because I was inspired to cut out my door frame and use it just as I read in the book.
The doors wobble and creak too much, it's pretty annoying.

But paying for sales software and not utilizing it to its max is even more annoying.
Instead, in 2nd gear, we hack together a free Sales Stack.

# Apollo.io is central to this. 

The free plan allows you to connect your inbox and send with your company alias.

The leads database is huge and you also get unlimited email finding credits.
You just can't export them. That means you can only send inside the system.

So let's say that you used up your 2 sequence right.
You want to go for 3rd.

You select all the contacts in a sequence.
Then you add them to a list, with the same name as the sequence.

Now, when you're in the database looking for new friends to make, you can exclude multiple lists.

After your lists are complete you can archive your sequence and start again.
That way, you'll be able to manage 2 sequences running in parallel, until you reach a major part of your TAM.

Our founder loves these kinds of constraints that force you to move slower and more deliberately. As a designer, he eats constraints for lunch and dinner. (No breakfast, intermittent fasting.)

It gets trickier if you have multiple email addresses.
Like me. 

I'm trying to impose disipline, by focusing one address on companies with 100-200 employees and the other on 200-500 employees.
